        <h1>Star Micronics cloudPRNT Simple Test Server</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>cloudPRNT is live</h2>
            <p>Congratulations, your test server is running. Please open the <a href="/printers">Printer List</a> to get started.
            </p>

            <h2>Configuring your Intelligent Interface</h2>
            <p>It is necessary to configure your Intelligent Interface to make sure that it is using this server and a suitable printer ID.</p>
            <p>To do this, please open the cloudPRNT configuration we bage of your Star Printer. The correct CloudPRNT URL
             depends on how you are running/accessing this server. If the server is running on your private PC then the URL should be: <em>http://[serverIP]:8080/starcloudprnt</em> and you can use any one of the prepared printer ID's visible on the
            <a href="/printers">printer list</a> page. If you are acessing the SME hosted version of this server then the cloudPRNT URL is <em>http://cloud.stareu.net/starcloudprnt</em></p>.

            <h2>Firewall Checking</h2>
            <p>If you have trouble acessing this server from other computers, or using the Intelligent Interface, then please check the
            firewall settings of the PC that you are using to run the server. It is necessary to allow incoming tcp connections on port 8080.</p>
            <p>Also please not that it is necessary to run the server as Administrator, for Windows to allow it to receive web requests.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>This server does not implement security features for the demo. However cloudPRNT does fully support http authentication, and
            https/TLS encryption.</p>
